## 📖 Overview  
The **Weather Forecast App** provides real-time weather information and forecasts for any city in the world.  
It’s a responsive and interactive web app built to strengthen my front-end development and API integration skills.  

Users can search for a city to view its **temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and more**, displayed in a clean and modern interface.
